# Solar-energy-generation-predictor-and-the-relation-between-weather-and-the-solar-energy-generation
This ML model is designed t predict the future solar energy generations in different districts in Sri Lanka, at different times. In addition to that this model helps the user to identify if there is a correlation between the solar energy generation and the weather factors such as rainfall, humidity, and cloud coverage. The data sets used for this project are strictly cnfidential and can only be used with the permission from Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka.
